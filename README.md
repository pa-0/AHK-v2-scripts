# AHK v2 scripts  

[AutoHotkey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/) scripts with examples of commonly used commands, shortcut keys and several small functions for various applications, written in AHK v2. 

Any suggestions for improving the script code are welcome.  

Standalone scripts for each function will be created soon.
